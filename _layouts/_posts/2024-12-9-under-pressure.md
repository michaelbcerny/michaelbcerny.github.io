        <div class="subtitle">“Under Pressure: Attitudes Towards China Among American Foreign Policy Professionals”</div>
        <p class="body-text">
            How do career and reputational concerns affect China policy discourse within the Washington foreign policy community? 
            We conducted over 50 semi-structured interviews and a novel survey experiment of nearly five-hundred American foreign 
            policy and national security professionals about their views towards the People’s Republic of China. Contrary to concerns 
            of a rigid consensus, we identify a noticeable diversity of policy perspectives among these professionals.

        <p class="body-text">
            However, many participants perceived a degree of what they referred to as “hawkflation” or “groupthink.” Roughly one-fourth 
            of survey respondents noted instances of professional pressure to voice a more hawkish point of view towards China, and many 
            feared being perceived as naive or compromised by their views on, ties to, and experiences in China. These pressures were 
            particularly noteworthy for foreign policy professionals that are traditionally marginalized from power—those who are younger, 
            non-white, or female. Our subjects reported a number of different strategies to cope with these pressures, including mirroring 
            hawkish rhetoric in their advice, modifying or self-censoring their views in public settings, and even exiting the field entirely. 
            Taken together, these social dynamics appear to foster perceptions of “consensus” and bias policy discourse towards hawkish 
            prescriptions and inflated threats.
